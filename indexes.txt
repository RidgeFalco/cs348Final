I have added four indexes, the first is on User.user_id, the second is on User.username, the third is on AlbumReview.score, and the fourth is on AlbumReview.album

For the first index will be helpful for a query such as:
    "g.user = sesh.scalar(select(User).where(User.user_id == user_id))"
Which this query is called a lot as before loading any page and this is done to set the current user

The second index will be very useful for a login query like:
    "result = sesh.scalar(select(User).where(User.username == username))"
Which this query is called whenever a user is trying to log in, that way the password information can be accessed.

The third and fourth index will be useful for getting the average album review score which is used in the query:
    "avgRatingStmt = select(func.avg(AlbumReview.score).label("AverageRating")).where(AlbumReview.album == albumId)"
This query benfits from having all the scores and then also by saving the album ids in the reviews.
